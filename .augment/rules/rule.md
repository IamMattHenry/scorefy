# Global Rules for Coding Best Practices

1. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code with consistent formatting.  
2. Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript).  
3. Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.  
4. Write modular code: break problems into small, reusable functions or classes.  
5. Add comments and docstrings where necessary, but avoid redundant comments.  
6. Prefer clarity over cleverness â€” optimize for readability before micro-optimizations.  
7. Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully with proper exception handling.  
8. Avoid hardcoding values; use constants, configuration files, or environment variables.  
9. Write unit tests for important functions and aim for good test coverage.  
10. Keep functions short: one function should do one thing well.  
11. Avoid duplicate code; refactor into reusable components when possible.  
12. Use version control (git) with clear, descriptive commit messages.  
13. Document APIs and key workflows for future developers.  
14. Prioritize security: sanitize inputs, avoid secrets in code, and follow least privilege principles.  
15. Write efficient code but never sacrifice readability for premature optimization.  
16. Use dependency management tools (npm, pip, etc.) and pin versions where appropriate.  
17. Follow SOLID principles for object-oriented design when applicable.  
18. Keep codebase consistent: if you change conventions, update all related code.  
19. Review and test code before merging into main branches.  
20. Continuously learn and apply industry best practices to improve code quality.
